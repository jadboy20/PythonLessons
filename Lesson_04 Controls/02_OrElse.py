# This lesson we will learn about the ELSE control. 
#
# If you say Marko is spelled with a K, then that is TRUE
#
# If you say Marko is spelled with anything ELSE, that is False!
#
# We use Else statements to run code that runs if the previous IF statement
# is not true. 
#
# Think about when you're hungry. 
# If you're hungry, you will eat. 
# ELSE
# you don't eat!
# 
# There isn't really another option is there!

def main():
	
	# Using ELSE statement is like using the IF statement, except you
	# do not have a CONDITION. 
	# if Condition :
	#     # CODE
	# else:
	#     # Other code. 
	# 
	# See how there is no condition after else?
	# Lets see one in action!
