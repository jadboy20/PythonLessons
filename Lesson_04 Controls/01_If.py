# 01_If.py
# 
# This lesson we will learn about IF statements. e
# We can use if statements to control things. 
#
# Think about if you're hungry. 
# IF you're hungry, you will eat.
# IF NOT then don't eat. 
# 
# You can also think of the time. 
# If the time later than 8:00PM, then we finish the lesson
# If the time is less than 7:00PM, then we don't start the lesson yet
# If the time is between 7:00PM and 8:00PM, we are having the lesson. 

def main():
	
	# There are three parts to an if statement.
	# You have the IF component. Then the condition. Then the Code 
	# that runs when the condition is met. 
	# Lets try a simple one. 
	
	# We start with the IF and then the condition, which is True
	if True:
		# Now we write the code to run if the condition is true. 
		print("This is true!")
		
	# IF the condition is false, the code inside the IF statement will 
	# not be run. 
	if False:
		# This part will not run. 
		print("I will never run!")
		
		
	# Try you're own "if true:" statement, but write your own print 
	# code in there. 
	
	
	if True:
		print("Hey there!")
	
	if True: 
		print("Sorry we are occupied!")
