# Comments.py
# This lesson is about commenting.
#
# What you are reading now is a comment. Notice how it is a different 
# colour to the rest of the program and that it always starts with the 
# "#" character? 
#
# Comments are used to give programmers little messages that help them
# understand your code better. Its like showing the working for you 
# math questions. You don't want to include it in you calculations. You
# just want the teacher to read it. 
#
# Lets try some comments. 

def main():
	# I AM A COMMENT. I WILL BE IGNORED!!!!
	print("I am not a comment. I will be run!")
	# print("I have been commented out! Now I won't be run.")
	# print("To get me to run, remove the hash from infront of me!!!")
	
	# Now make your own comments! VV

	# This means hi, how are  you?
	print("cao kakosi?")
	return 0
